# lg-tv-adapter

LG webOS TV adapter for the [Mozilla IoT gateway](https://iot.mozilla.org).

Lets the gateway interact with webOS-based LG TVs.

**NOTE:** Before connecting to your device, you need to allow "LG Connect Apps" on your TV. See [this page](http://www.lg.com/uk/support/product-help/CT00008334-1437131798537-others) for instructions.

## Usage

Normally you will just want to install this from the add-ons list provided by the gateway.

After installing the add-on, it will search for devices on the network and automatically try to pair with them. You will manually have to accept the pairing request on the TV before you can control the device.
